John Major
==========

Bio
---

John major is a former decker and getaway driver for a bank robbing gang. When
a job went south, he was left scorched by the security systems. He has access
to a lot of money stashed during his bank robbing days, but he has become a
paranoid conspiracy theorist and lives off the grid in his armoured personnel
carrier to avoid the attention of the lizard people.

Born into a middle class family, John gave up a promising career in the family
business selling lawn ornaments for a life of crime after reading too much
William Gibson.  He learned computer security from nerds on the internet, and
soon had the power to cause havoc by typing 'DROP TABLE' into websites written
by stupid people.  Soon he was running with a bank robbing gang, where his
aptititude for technology and ability to crack even the hardest security
systems proved invaluable.

One day though, John's luck ran out.  After penetrating the most sophisticated
bank vault of his career, the gang were about to make off with a king's ransom
in credit sticks when the kleptomaniac Maggie couldn't resist trying to steal a
great big shiny gold thing which turned out to be a trap.  Thanks to John's
hacking they made it out alive but, as they drove away he was still plugged in,
and the bank's security overcame his defences leaving him scorched.

Unable to work, John became paranoid and began living in a tinfoil lined
armoured personnel carrier he had bought as military surplus. He now drives
around the streets of Birmingham trying to avoid the attentions of the lizard
people who secretly run the world.

### Maggie & Dennis

John knows a fence called Dennis from his bank robbing days.  Dennis became a
fence in order to palm off the massive pile of stolen goods in their house
thanks to the antics of his kleptomaniac wife Maggie, who has been known even
to steal cartons of milk from school children.
