BIO
---

John major is a former decker and getaway driver for a bank robbing gang. When
a job went south, he was left scorched by the security systems. He has access
to a lot of money stashed during his bank robbing days, but he has become a
paranoid conspiracy theorist and lives off the grid in his armoured personnel
carrier to avoid the attention of the lizard people.
